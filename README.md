# EC607 Core Metrics 2023 Spring LAB

## Welcome!

This is a repo for EC607 Spring Core Metrics Lab session in support of [Ed](https://edrub.in/)'s [Economics 607: Econometrics III (Spring 2021)](https://github.com/edrubin/EC607S23).
You can find all related files like .R in this page.

Our lab will be mostly going through R code with me, so I highly recommend bringing your laptop to our sessions. Priority of this lab is of course introducing necessary codes or skills for your assignments and exams, but I will also try to address some issues that I find useful for your future research.

I am going to use R script, not slides, during lab but Ed and [Philip](https://github.com/peconomi/spring2021_core_metrics_lab#core-metrics-iii-lab) have great extensive resources for R in slides. 
One hour is pretty short to cover all relevant tools. Therefore you should look into these slides carefully and many times google it by yourself on missing parts. I strongly believe that this is also a part of your training(Later you'll spend trementdous time in googling codes you are looking for). 

Uploaded scripts are all without any notes or description.
They are to help you follow steps during lab. 
I highly suggest you to make your own version of code templates with your own notes and descriptions.
